# Demo Audio File Information

This is a placeholder for a demo audio file. In a real implementation, you would have an actual MP3/WAV file here.

For demonstration purposes, the application uses hardcoded data that simulates the analysis of a business meeting audio file.

## Sample Audio Content (Simulated):
- Duration: ~4 minutes
- Speakers: 2 (Meeting facilitator and participant)
- Content: Business meeting about project budget
- Background sounds: Music, vehicle, phone ring, door opening
- Emotions detected: Confident, calm, professional

## To add a real demo audio file:
1. Record or obtain a sample audio file (MP3/WAV format)
2. Name it "demo-audio.mp3" 
3. Place it in this directory
4. The application will automatically detect and use it

## File Requirements:
- Format: MP3, WAV, or M4A
- Duration: 1-10 minutes recommended
- Content: Speech with some background sounds
- Size: Under 50MB for web compatibility
